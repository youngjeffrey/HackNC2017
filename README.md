_Lemon Clicker_

The Lemon Clicker is an Android game we developed for the 2017 HackNC. It is a variant of the popular game Cookie Clicker where in
this game the player tries to amass as many lemons as possible over a period of time. The layout is designed using Android Studio 
and the back end is written in Java. It includes touch events and built in timers to allow for the lemon amount to increment.
